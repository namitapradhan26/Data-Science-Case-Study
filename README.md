# Data-Science-Case-Study
 Investigated and analyzed the accompanying data set, producing a model that can be used to predict the “target”

The data set consists of three ﬁles:

targets.csv - contains the binary “target” labels for the data set to be used in modeling, matched to a pair of unique identiﬁers for a patient’s proﬁle and biomarkers data

patient_proﬁles.json - contains various information on patient data points

biomarkers.csv - contains several binary columns marking the presence of known biomarkers (though, deliberately left without further context)
